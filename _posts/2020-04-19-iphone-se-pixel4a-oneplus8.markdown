Apple released a budget option, OnePlus	released an expensive 8 Series, and will the upcoming Google Pixel 4a and 5 be worth it?

### Apple iPhone SE (2020) was released for 400 USD

Probably the most sought after question regarding smartphones right now is whether the new iPhone SE (2020) is worth the asking price of 400 USD? And I would say both yes and no. if you have been rocking an iPhone 7 or older, and love the size and design, it is pretty much a no brainer. Four or more year smartphones cannot match the new SE in pretty much anything, from the feature set, performance, camera quality, etc.. However, if you haven't been living under a rock and bought a phone in the last two or three years, there might be better options for you. The new SE is still an upgraded phone from 2017 and nothing more. First of all the design, it doesn't look new in any means, the same goes for ergonomics. These days phones with a similar footprint could offer much larger and probably better screens. Then there is the charging situation. The phone supports fast charging, however, it is nothing compared to current smartphones with 30+ watt chargers, and you have to buy the fast charger separately. Last, but probably most important, the battery is tiny! Less than 2000 mAh is pretty much unacceptable in 2020. The new SE will perform okay and might charge reasonably fast, however, you will most likely kill it in a few hours. And then there are the small things, no headphone jack, LCD screen, and no type C port instead of the lightning. I would not say that iPhone SE (2020) is a bad phone. It's a great phone, from 2017.

### OnePlus 8 Series gets _really_ expensive

On the other side of the price, spectrum stands the newly announced OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, starting at 699 and 899 respectively. While the phones look very nice design-wise and probably perform great as well, was the price hike justified? Well, first of all, it is necessary to say that certain components cost much more this year than the previous generation. The processor by Qualcomm requires a separate 5G modem, which is not integrated this time around, is reportedly much more expensive. While it is a way for Qualcomm to increase their revenue, since 4G modems are not available for the Snapdragon 865 processors, the company need to recoup the costs associated with the development of the 5G standards. Then there are the amazing screens, which on both models are class-leading flexible OLED panels. and lastly, there are cameras. While the Pro has 4 of them, the non-Pro version has three. While most of the sensors are very high quality, some of those are there just for the count or a gimmick. The macro lens in OnePlus 8 is a joke and the color filter camera in the 8 Pro is a feature nobody asked for.
If OnePlus wanted to make the phones cheaper they definitely could, however, this whole thing depends on the strategical shifts of the brand to push into the top market segment. Maybe the new OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro are not for me, however, if someone is deciding between the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and the 8 Pro, I would recommend going for the OnePlus. Unfortunately, I am not as convinced by the regular 8, the updates seem to be fairly marginal over the previous OnePlus 7T, especially at the price of 699. While the 5G promises great things, almost no one is in the position to properly exploit these capabilities.

### Google Pixel 4a is coming the next few months with Pixel 5 towards the end of the year.

At this point we know almost everything about the Pixel 4a, most likely another 399 USD mid-range phone with great software and (single) camera, but in a plastic body and without the high-end features. To be perfectly honest, it does not seem like a bad deal, especially, if Google manages to release a phone with a fairly good performance and in more markets than up until now. Google Pixel line of phones tend to do 95% of the things right, and then screw up the last 5%. I sincerely hope that this won't be the case this year, and we can finally say that the 4a and 5 are great phones, not just great value or nice software experience.

### Battle of the budget ($399) and mid-range ($699) market segment

One thing that might change the situation on the smartphone market is the pricing tendencies of the manufacturers, mostly set by Apple, with others following. in 2016 Apple set the upper-budget price to be 400 USD with the iPhone SE, then Google and others started releasing phones at this price range and the battle is heating up with the SE (2020), Pixel 4a, and most likely the rumored OnePlus 8Z (or just Z), as well as last year's compact flagships. Then there is the upper mid-range segment of iPhone 11, Pixel 4, Oneplus 8, Galaxy S20, and others. It is going to be interesting to see which features from the high-end trickle down to the 699 USD price range in 2020 and the upcoming generations.
