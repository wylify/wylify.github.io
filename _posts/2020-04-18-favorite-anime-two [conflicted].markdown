In the eastern cultures, animated or hand-drawn characters and stories are part of daily life, in the west, we mostly think of it as something mainly for children or over-sized children in the form of comics or superhero movies. It is not that often that you see a western brand to have an infantile and very cute mascot that represents it and communicates with the public.

This is just one of many examples where we can see the importance of animation and drawn media in certain parts of the world. Animation gives much more power to the artist to communicate, create, and symbolize, over a live-action or CG medium, especially because of its accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Animated or drawn media can look weird and nobody minds, just compare anime and live-action versions of Pokemon.

And while I believe that most of us at least heard or watched some form of anime when they were kids or teenagers, we tend to stop at that and never look back. However, this view just limits us from discovering the broad world of animation aimed at older audiences.

## What do I mean?

Well, since most of us have slightly more time on our hands that what we would maybe prefer these days, I would like to list just a few of my favorite titles for you to glance at and maybe even get inspired to watch it.

The titles are in no particular order and range from very tame and accessible to a more gruesome and rough around the edges. You might find that my pick fits you perfectly or maybe that you only are interested in one or two shows, therefore I suggest you have a look online and explore what this medium has to offer. I recommend you to look at [MyAnimeList.net (MAL)](https://myanimelist.net), Youtube (for example [GIGGUK](https://www.youtube.com/user/gigguk/featured)) or [Mother's Basement](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBs2Y3i14e1NWQxOGliatmg/featured)) ), and the wide selection of titles on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/6721?bc=83)).

### Violet Evergarden

Are you less into pure gore and prefer more emotions and deeper stories in the things you watch? While I would say that Violet Evergarden is not for everyone, since it's more about self-discovery and life hardships, it compensates it with a few action-packed scenes and probably the most beautiful animation I have seen from an anime. In the center of a story, we find Violet, an ex-soldier looking for her place in the regular world without the war ravaging all around, by helping people write letters to their loved ones.

Violet Evergarden is available on Netflix. (full season, special, and a movie)

### Nana

By now Nana is a classic in the realm of anime. Again it's more about human emotions and focuses on a story of two girls, accidentally both called Nana. However, the two girls can't be more different. While the first Nana is quite naive and inexperienced, the second Nana is much tougher and emotionally mature. Nevertheless, both of them become roommates and friends, from this point on the whole world changes for both of them. The episodes are quite slow, however, masterfully written and directed. Worth a watch for someone looking for a series, both heavier and more real.

### Castlevania

Finally, we got to the Castlevania! The third season was recently released and it inspired me to write this list of favorite anime.
Castlevania is based on the story from a video game series of the same name. However, you would not notice that unless someone told you before. The whole series looks at the story of Dracula, his family, and regular humans, through the eyes of disgraced noble fighting vampires and other supernatural beings. While the premise might not sound that interesting for some, I would highly recommend giving Castelvania a chance.

All seasons are available on Netflix.

### Neo Yokio

![neo yokio](/assets/img/2020/04/neoyokio.jpg)

Have you ever thought what if the US wasn't colonized by the British, but rather the whole country was much more Japanese? No?!? Never? Well, that doesn't matter since someone has done it for you? Welcome to Neo Yokio, a mix of New York and Tokyo, ruled by aristocrats and powerful families. While the premise of the show is a bit whacky, it's quite funny and doesn't take itself too seriously.

All episodes are available on Netflix.

### Your Name

![your name](/assets/img/2020/04/yourname.jpg)

Back to a slightly more serious note, Your Name is a beautifully drawn anime movie about two teenagers, a girl, and a boy, living in completely different environments. While one is busy with school and a job in bustling Tokyo, the other one is living a much calmer life in a village, dreaming of moving to Tokyo. However, one day both of them wake up to realize they swapped bodies.

### Akira

![akira](/assets/img/2020/04/akira.jpg)

A cult classic that revolutionized the medium, telling a story of a bike gang in a Blade Runner-esque world. Akira is full of gore, action, fast bike-chases, however, it doesn't skimp on emotions, life, complicated friendships and relationships. While it shows its age in terms of the animation, the movie is a must for any fan of the genre.

### Flavours of Youth

In case you just finished watching Akira and need something calm and soothing, then I would recommend the anime movie Flavours of Youth. The animation of this piece is exceptional in both its detail and simplicity, while the story is split into three parts, each following a different protagonist and their life story. The stories are filled with love, life, and friendships, and their developments over time. Oh, and have I mentioned the beautifully drawn food, which looks even better than the real thing?

Available in its entirety on Netflix.

I hope you enjoyed this short series of articles and that maybe you found something new you liked.
