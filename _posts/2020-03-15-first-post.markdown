Starting a blog ten years too late is not an easy feat. At the same time, I do not intend to write a post every few days and maybe not even every few weeks.

Over the past years I have tried to set up numerous blogs, however, I would not stick with them and eventually stop. This time I am not planning to set myself up for a failure, rather am I having a much more relaxed approach and this medium is where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and pretty much anything creative. Building a positive space set to reflect my contemporary mindset.

## Creative Playground

At the same time I would love to post more of my photos together with a broader descriptions and observations from my travels. I have been quite active on Instagram in the past months after almost a year long break from posting. While there have been numerous reasons why I stopped engaging with social media, one of them was my constant need for gratification from others. I would chase likes and follow counts more than art itself. Eventually, I realized that this is not what I want and that the joy I once got from it was gone. At the same time, I was more focused on my studies and had a bit of a rough period.

While I find writing quite therapeutic, the thought of clicking on "Publish" was always terrifying. Putting content out there for others to see and judge would bring new anxiety with thought such as "I am not good enough" or "it's lame and boring." Therefore, this is an opening of a new chapter about learning, improvement, and building of self-esteem. Glad you are here to see it.
