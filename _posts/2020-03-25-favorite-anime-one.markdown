In the eastern cultures, animated or hand-drawn characters and stories are part of daily life, in the west, we mostly think of it as something mainly for children or over-sized children in the form of comics or superhero movies. It is not that often that you see a western brand to have an infantile and very cute mascot that represents it and communicates with the public.

This is just one of many examples where we can see the importance of animation and drawn media in certain parts of the world. Animation gives much more power to the artist to communicate, create, and symbolize, over a live-action or CG medium, especially because of its accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Animated or drawn media can look weird and nobody minds, just compare anime and live-action versions of Pokemon.

And while I believe that most of us at least heard or watched some form of anime when they were kids or teenagers, we tend to stop at that and never look back. However, this view just limits us from discovering the broad world of animation aimed at older audiences.

## What do I mean?

Well, since most of us have slightly more time on our hands that what we would maybe prefer these days, I would like to list just a few of my favorite titles for you to glance at and maybe even get inspired to watch it.

The titles are in no particular order and range from very tame and accessible to a more gruesome and rough around the edges. You might find that my pick fits you perfectly or maybe that you only are interested in one or two shows, therefore I suggest you have a look online and explore what this medium has to offer. I recommend you to look at [MyAnimeList.net (MAL)](https://myanimelist.net), Youtube (for example [GIGGUK](https://www.youtube.com/user/gigguk/featured)) or [Mother's Basement](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBs2Y3i14e1NWQxOGliatmg/featured)) ), and the wide selection of titles on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/6721?bc=83)).

### One Punch Man

![one punch man](/assets/img/2020/03/one-punch.jpg)

One Punch Man follows Saitama, a regular man who through his experiences in the past decided to become _**a hero for fun**_. You might think that this backstory leaves a lot to be desired and you would be right. As we follow the story you see both the stakes and destruction to escalate, however, the main protagonist could not care less. One of the main points of the series is the fact that Saitama is so strong, he can surpass each enemy with just a single punch. Therefore most of the time we see him struggling with boredom, lack of motivation, and loneliness.

Meanwhile, the show is full of ridiculous characters, comical moments, superhero tropes, and a ton of self-awareness & criticism. Available on Netflix.

### Mob Psycho 100

![mob psycho 100](/assets/img/2020/03/mobpsycho.jpg)

Written by the same person as One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100, is a look at a character with powerful psychic abilities and his struggle with being special. Mob, the hero of the story, is a young kid from Japan, who can exorcise demons and other supernatural beings. Not only that, but he also seems to be one of the most powerful psychics out there, surrounded by hordes of phonies, pretending to help others, for money of course. While Mob has strong powers, he navigates the world with a child's naivete. He is being taken advantage of by many people around him, and especially his _master_, Reigen.

This show shares many characteristics with the One Punch Man such as the style of humor, personas, and the approach of their development.

### Children of the Whales

![children of the whales](/assets/img/2020/03/whales.jpg)

Unlike the previous entries, Children of the Whales is not a comedy and most certainly not for everyone. The story incorporates fantasy and mystery into a masterpiece full of emotions. The story is happening in a supernatural world, where the remaining people live on top of small islands (Mud Whales), sailing through the oceans of sand. Searching for new tribes and exploring new islands. As time progresses the protagonists encounter a being that changes their lives forever.

Children of the Whales is a beautifully drawn, excellently written, and mysterious exercise of human imagination. Available on Netflix.

### Cowboy Bebop

![cowboy bebop](/assets/img/2020/03/bebop.jpg)

Taking place in a futuristic world similar to the series The Expanse, the crew of the ship named "Bebop," each with their past and sophistication, navigates the space and travels between numerous planets and space stations. The protagonists earn a living by working as bounty hunters, cowboys, which always brings them to new, and many times, dangerous situations. At the same time, members of the crew are running away from their past, which is slowly catching up.

Cowboy Bebop is a cult classic and a must-see for fans of westerns, anime, and great music!    

### Samurai Champloo

![samurai champloo](/assets/img/2020/03/champloo.jpg)

I have to admit I got into anime way too late and Samurai Champloo is a classic from 2005, which I have only seen recently. This was a mistake! The story takes place in 14th century Japan, where an orphan teen girl working at a cafe meets two samurai warriors fighting one another. Long story short, the samurai attack a son of a local sovereign, get into trouble, the girl helps them escape, and as a sign of thanks promise to join her on a journey to find a person from her past.

Samurai Champloo explores the depth of human emotion, the artistry of warriors, and does so with an amazing soundtrack by the artist [Nujabes](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E4BO0EW30VEmk).

### Death Note

![death note](/assets/img/2020/03/note.jpg)

What would you do in case you would find a supernatural notebook with the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it? The Death Note explores this situation with a handful of drama, suspense, and mystery.

Available on Netflix.

### Kakegurui

![kakegurui](/assets/img/2020/03/kakegurui.jpg)

After watching a few anime series or movies, you start to recognize various tropes of the genre, such as the types of characters or the setting of the stories. While I find this as one of the biggest drawbacks of anime production in general, sometimes I have to admire the creativity of the directors and writers where they put a completely different spin on various elements of themes. Probably the most common trope/setting of anime series is high school. Aside from why this might be, the anime called Kakegurui introduces a high school setting, where pretty much the whole school is being run by gambling. The story gets weird and creepy at times, however, I encourage you to give it a chance and let yourself be entertained by high schoolers putting their lives on the line to win over their classmates.

Both seasons are available on Netflix.

### Devilman Crybaby

![devilman crybaby](/assets/img/2020/03/devilman.jpg)

If the previous recommendation wasn't weird enough, I present to you Devilman Crybaby. In a world where demons are planning on overtaking the human race, two friends, Arika and Ryo fight together to stop them. The story contains various philosophical elements, however, doing so with loads of gore in the style of the cult classic Akira.

One of my top picks, and an anime that introduced me to the genre. Available on Netflix.

### Aggretsuko

![aggretsuko](/assets/img/2020/03/aggretsuko.jpg)

After previous titles on the Aggretsuko presents a nice and light intermezzo. The protagonist of the story is a cute anthropomorphic red panda working in a large Japanese corporation as an accountant. While she hates her job from the bottom of her heart, she always puts up a calm and friendly face. Nevertheless, she has a secret she doesn't want anyone to know. When under a lot of stress she goes to a karaoke place and sings, you guessed it, heavy metal songs.

Both seasons are available on Netflix.

I will be sharing the second part of this post in the next few days with even more great anime recommendations. While I focused mostly on anime series, part two consists of both series and feature-length movies.
