I bought an Apple iPad Pro 10.5 in 2018, used it, sold it, and bought the iPad Pro 11 in 2019. Having zero regrets about my purchase, you probably should not buy either of them.

First of all, I bought both iPads second-hand, and both of the times the sellers found the device to collect dust on their coffee tables. Apple has this quality of making people feel the need for their devices, even though there is no clear use case for it in their lives. Most likely the same thing happened here, where they thought that it would be cool to just have a nice device for drawing, watching movies, etc.. However, this never materialized and I was the person to get the underutilized tablets off their hands.

While I wasn't fully aware that many tablets are mostly unused, the market stagnation most certainly suggested this phenomenon is fairly widespread. For numerous years now, buying any other tablet than an iPad (excluding Windows 2-in-1s) is complete nonsense. Apple gradually released iPads in the full spectrum of prices and sizes, from just around $300 to well over $1000. At the same time, some advanced features tricked down-market, so even the cheapest iPad supports the Apple Pencil. Either way, having an iPad is not necessary for most of the population, especially as more and more laptops come with touch screens, convertible designs, and lighter chassis.

Owning a tablet can still sound like a great idea, however, wait until you want to watch a movie on it or write something. Both of those activities not only can be done on a laptop, and probably more comfortably, but also most likely require an accessory such as a case with a kickstand or a keyboard. Therefore the price of a tablet is not a final one until you count in things like a case, maybe a stylus, or even a screen protector. None of these are necessary for a regular laptop.

### Do I hate tablets?

No, not in the slightest, however, I believe that tablets are amazing for people with specific tasks they want to accomplish on them. At the same time, I use my iPad very regularly and without a doubt, it is one of my favorite devices to work with. I decided to purchase my first iPad Pro for two things, notetaking, and photo-editing. I have researched the viable apps for these use cases and found two I liked. First being MyScript's Nebo, for its superior handwriting recognition software, and Adobe Lightroom CC, for photo editing. It most certainly helped I already was an Adobe CC subscriber, therefore the fully-featured mobile app was included. The app received great ratings from both the public and professionals, so the switch seemed like a fairly good alternative to the desktop suite.

### Writing on an iPad

I was successful in replacing most of my paper notes and Google Docs documents by writing with Nebo. Not only saving on space and weight I needed to carry with me to school, but research shows that writing by hand increases our ability to remember things, therefore the iPad had a secondary positive effect. While the app at the time had fewer features than now, writing on it wasn't too hard to get used to. It most certainly helps if your writing is neat, however, even someone like me was able to use the app daily for multiple hours. For reference, I am pretty much the only person who can read after myself, most of the time.

### What about those photos?

I have to say that this was probably the best thing I could have done. Up untill that point, I edited all the photos on my Dell laptop from 2015. While it was doable, it most certainly wasn't enjoyable. The laptop took forever to load a photo and then a heavier edit could bring it to a standstill. It wasn't as much of a fault of my laptop than the level of optimization of the Adobe Lightroom, nevertheless, using the modern mobile app brought a night and a day difference to my whole editing workflow. Even though I had to switch up a few things and the whole image transfer from camera to lightroom was most certainly much more complicated, it was well worth the extra few steps in the beginning.

### Using an iPad is still a bit of a pain in the ...

While the continuous updates bring new and more advanced features to the iPadOS it still isn't as good or polished as it could be. My greatest gripe is with the Files app. I could live with imperfect cloud storage integration and lack of certain features, however, the constant crashing and freezing are making me furious every time. The second thing that I would love to see improved is the Photos app. Here we can see that Apple thinks that their users are really stupid. The app hides most of the information about the files itself, including the file size and resolution and most of the EXIF data, which is quite important for me as an avid photographer. Then there are the common issues such as that files inside the apps are most of the time completely cut out from the Files app, etc.. If Apple wants to see wider adoption of iPadOS, they need to add the small, more niche features which many users demand from their computing devices. This is one of the reasons why I still prefer Android as an operating system, even though it has some quirks on its own.

In the end, I just want to say that before you pull the trigger and buy that shiny new tablet, really decide on the tasks you want to perform on it, and how often do you plan on using it. Because if you just want a general device for a bit of everything, it is quite fair to say that your laptop and phone are doing a pretty good job.
