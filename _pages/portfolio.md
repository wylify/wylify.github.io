Let's make one thing clear, I am not a photographer. At least I would not call myself one. I have had photography jobs before and I have been paid for my photography skills occasionally. I would say I am a visual person, always have been. I started taking photos actively around the year 2012, running around town with my phone, snapping whatever I found interesting. When I borrowed a DSLR from my girlfriend my passion for the art grew substantially. The camera was nothing special, and I used it with a cheap kit lens, however, it was a great way to learn about how digital cameras work, how to frame a photo and create something great in the process. Till this day one of my favorite photos was taken on that camera. Another thing that fueled my dedication was the _little_ known social network called Instagram. Well, and the rest is history, right?

### Why do I take photos?

Taking photos for me is a way how to communicate my perceptions with the rest of the world. What do I mean exactly? Well you see, whenever we are on the street, at a coffee place, or just at home, we all grasp our surroundings differently. You might focus on how the reflecting light from a lamp hits the texture of the wall or the table, or how the flowers on the table are drying up and their petals are slowly piling up on the floor. While I might see how the warm color of the sunlight coming in through the window change the color of the room from white to light orange. The point is, you and I might be at the same spot, however, our perceptions might differ diametrically. My understanding of photography, as an art form, is an exercise of empathy. Being able to feel what other people feel. When looking at photos of others', I try to see their perspectives (_both cognitive & literal_) and get inspired by them. Furthermore, the inspiration from others' pushes me to bring certain elements over to my style of photography. Slowly shifting, drifting, and merging various techniques into something uniquely mine.
