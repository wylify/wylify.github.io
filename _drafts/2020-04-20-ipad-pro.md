<p>I bought an Apple iPad Pro 10.5 in 2018, used it, sold it, and bought the iPad Pro 11 in 2019. Having zero regrets about my purchase, you probably should not buy either of them.</p>
<p>First of all you should know that I bought both iPads second-hand, and both of the times the sellers found the device to collecting dust on a coffee table. Apple has this quality of making people feel the need for their devices, even though there is no clear use case for it in their lives. Most likely the same thing happened here, where they thought that it would be cool to just have a nice device for drawing, watching movies, etc… However, this never materialized and I was the person to get the underutuilized tablets off their hands.</p>
<p>While I wasn’t fully aware that many tablets are mostly unused, the market stagnation most certainly suggested this phenomenon is more widely spread.</p>
