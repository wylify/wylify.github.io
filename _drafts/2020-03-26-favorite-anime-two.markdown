In the eastern cultures, animated or hand-drawn characters and stories are part of daily life, in the west, we mostly think of it as something mainly for children or over-sized children in the form of comics or superhero movies. It is not that often that you see a western brand to have an infantile and very cute mascot that represents it and communicates with the public.

This is just one of many examples where we can see the importance of animation and drawn media in certain parts of the world. Animation gives much more power to the artist to communicate, create, and symbolize, over a live-action or CG medium, especially because of its accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Animated or drawn media can look weird and nobody minds, just compare anime and live-action versions of Pokemon.

And while I believe that most of us at least heard or watched some form of anime when they were kids or teenagers, we tend to stop at that and never look back. However, this view just limits us from discovering the broad world of animation aimed at older audiences.

## What do I mean?

Well, since most of us have slightly more time on our hands that what we would maybe prefer these days, I would like to list just a few of my favorite titles for you to glance at and maybe even get inspired to watch it.

The titles are in no particular order and range from very tame and accessible to a more gruesome and rough around the edges. You might find that my pick fits you perfectly or maybe that you only are interested in one or two shows, therefore I suggest you have a look online and explore what this medium has to offer. I recommend you to look at [MyAnimeList.net (MAL)](https://myanimelist.net), Youtube (for example [GIGGUK](https://www.youtube.com/user/gigguk/featured)) or [Mother's Basement](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBs2Y3i14e1NWQxOGliatmg/featured)) ), and the wide selection of titles on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/6721?bc=83)).
